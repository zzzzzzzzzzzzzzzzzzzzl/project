My biggest weakness is probably organisation, appologies if this is a jumble.

I looked through the reasearch repositories of the others to get a clearer idea of what the asignment was.
Most of the other people had a reflective journal. I didnt do that, Im writting all of this at 6:22 pm 2/09/2022.
I was going to arragne all of the information that I used in a git hub repository and in this README ill reflect on some of my thoughts and 
how i devoloped some of my ideas.


Im quite impulsive with my ideas, meaning that I generaly dont think about them for very long and I will usualy go with the first one.
im not sure what the process of thumbnailing would be called in regards to software development, but generaly that would be a better aproach to generating ideas.
That being said though I really like random generation So I would like that to be the core of my project.

Initialy i had the idea of Generating Random 3d meshes, They wouldnt have been creatures, that would be way out of my skillset.I was more thinking of generating
abstract Shapes.  there would have been a random set of rules that would have described the generation of the shapes. but the way of generating them seems kind of boring.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWivmi9j608, this way of generating "creatures" seems much more exciting to me, so I started thinking of a way where I could implement a genetic algorithom like this.

I started developing an enginge in pygame for this.I could have used a prebuilt engine for this, which would have been a much smarter idea, since I only wanted to create a genetic algorithom for creatures,but I started making one in python ive started about a week ago and its clear to me now that this will be 75% of the work for the project. creating a world for creatures to inhabit.

for the program the creatures will be made of several classes.


I know that python is not the best when it comes to speed but its the laungauge that im most comfortable with 






# project
project for school
the main idea at the moment is to use py game to 
create creatures from 2d polygons that will evolve with each generation,using a genetic algorithim 
and the fitness will be based off of distance traveled.

i probably give a more clear explanation maybe ill make some slides or images
