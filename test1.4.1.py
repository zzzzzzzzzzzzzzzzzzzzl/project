how do we have 2 falling points which maintain a constant distance?


we have 2 points a1,b1 and bone which is the distance between them
and a2,b2 which is what we will have after we transform bone 

every frame we need to rotate the  bone(M) so that it maintains a constant length as a and b change y value

we can find what rotation we need for bone with =(M^2)-(y^2)
this will give us a2,b2

distrubution:
disturubution will be absed off of velocty 
the sum of the distrubution will be 1: v1+v2=s  vm1=v1/s  vm2=v2/s



to get the average we then go (a1[x]+b1[x])/2=mid1)
and do the same for a2 b2 (a2[x]+b2[x])/2=mid2)

mid2=mid1
mid1=((diff/2)*vm1)+m2+((diff/2)*vm2)
this will give us our x shift

to handle the y pull for when our 2 points are outside of each others range 
the dumb way we could do it would be to give both points an equall velocity
the smart way idk this dumb way would be fine if not ideal if we had a way to do velocity exchange

its fine whatever.we can shiftnkmnmn

WHAT IF THE Y ARE OUTSIDE OF EACH OTHERS RANGE
we need to get pull the y axis and we can use total velocicty to determine the distrubution.
